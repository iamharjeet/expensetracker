- Tested health endpoint (http://localhost:8080/actuator/health) returning status UP
- Confirmed all REST endpoints working in containerized environment (register, login, expenses, budgets, receipts)
- Application runs as non-root user 'spring' for security
- Docker image uses JRE (not JDK) for smaller production image size
- Successfully tested complete flow: container startup → database migration → app initialization → API access
  Step 21: DEFERRED to Post-MVP
- Step 22 completed: Implemented Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for AWS deployment in ca-central-1 (Canada - Montreal) region. 
- Created comprehensive cloud infrastructure including VPC with 2 public subnets across multiple availability zones (ca-central-1a, ca-central-1b), Internet Gateway, and route tables for network connectivity. 
- Provisioned RDS PostgreSQL 15 database (db.t3.micro, 20GB GP3 storage, encrypted at rest) with automated backups disabled for cost optimization, enhanced monitoring enabled (60-second intervals) with CloudWatch logs export (postgresql, upgrade logs), and IAM role for RDS monitoring. 
- Created S3 bucket (expensetracker-receipts-dev-harjeet2025) for receipt storage with server-side encryption (AES256), public access blocked, lifecycle policy (365-day retention with automatic deletion), CORS configuration for future browser uploads, and abort incomplete multipart uploads after 7 days. 
- Implemented IAM security with 3 roles (ECS task execution role with AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy, ECS task role with S3 and CloudWatch permissions, RDS monitoring role with AmazonRDSEnhancedMonitoringRole) and 2 custom policies for S3 access (PutObject, GetObject, DeleteObject, ListBucket) and CloudWatch logs (CreateLogGroup, CreateLogStream, PutLogEvents). 
- Configured 3 security groups for network isolation: ALB security group (allows HTTP/HTTPS from internet), ECS tasks security group (allows traffic from ALB on port 8080), and RDS security group (allows PostgreSQL port 5432 only from ECS tasks, blocks all other access). 
- Set up 2 CloudWatch log groups (/ecs/expensetracker-dev with 7-day retention, /ecs/expensetracker-dev-task with 3-day retention). 
- Total infrastructure: 28 AWS resources deployed via 12 Terraform files (main.tf, variables.tf, vpc.tf, security-groups.tf, rds.tf, s3.tf, iam.tf, cloudwatch.tf, outputs.tf, terraform.tfvars.example, .gitignore, README.md). 
- Successfully demonstrated Infrastructure as Code best practices, cost optimization (free tier eligible, single-AZ RDS, no NAT Gateway saves $32/month, S3 lifecycle policies), security hardening (encryption at rest and in transit, network isolation via security groups, RDS not publicly accessible despite being in public subnet, least privilege IAM policies, all secrets externalized), and professional DevOps workflow with comprehensive documentation. 
- All outputs captured including RDS endpoint (expensetracker-dev-db.cnaayeogwvw9.ca-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432), VPC ID (vpc-0df89024018d1f104), subnet IDs, security group IDs, IAM role ARNs, and S3 bucket name for use in Step 23 (ECS deployment). 
- Estimated monthly cost: ~$19-20 after free tier expires.
- Step 23 completed: Deployed application to AWS ECS Fargate with full observability
- Created 2 new Terraform files: ecs.tf (ECS Fargate cluster, task definition with environment variables, service with public IP) and cloudwatch-enhanced.tf (5 CloudWatch alarms for ECS/RDS monitoring, CloudWatch dashboard for visualization)
- Updated 3 existing Terraform files: variables.tf (added docker_image, ecs_task_cpu, ecs_task_memory, ecs_desired_count), outputs.tf (added ECS outputs and app access instructions), security-groups.tf (added public access rule on port 8080)
- Fixed AwsS3Config.java to use DefaultCredentialsProvider for IAM role authentication instead of hardcoded AWS credentials
- Pushed Docker image to Docker Hub (iamharjeet/expensetracker:latest) for deployment
- Deployed 11 new AWS resources via terraform apply: 1 ECS cluster, 1 task definition, 1 service, 5 alarms, 1 dashboard, plus updated security group
- Application running serverless on ECS Fargate at http://35.183.95.236:8080
- Using ECS Task IAM Role for S3 access (no AWS credentials needed in environment variables)
- Connected to RDS PostgreSQL database with Flyway migrations applied successfully
- Full CloudWatch monitoring: CPU/Memory alarms for ECS, CPU/Storage/Connections alarms for RDS
- CloudWatch Dashboard displays real-time metrics for ECS and RDS resources
- Cost optimization: No ALB ($16/month saved), Docker Hub instead of ECR ($1/month saved), single task (256 CPU, 512 MB RAM)
- Total cost: $0/month within AWS free tier (first 12 months), ~$27/month after free tier expires
- Production-grade deployment: Infrastructure as Code, container orchestration, comprehensive observability
