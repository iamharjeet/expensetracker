## Current Step: 8

## Notes:
- Step 1 completed: Basic Spring Boot project created
- GitHub repository initialized and pushed
- Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL, Lombok
- Step 2 completed: PostgreSQL running in Docker, User entity with timestamps and UserRepository created
- Database table 'users' successfully created with all fields including created_at and updated_at
- Step 3 completed: Built complete REST API for user management
- Created 3 new packages: dto, service, controller
- Created UserDTO, UserService, UserController
- Implemented 5 REST endpoints (GET all, GET by ID, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Successfully tested all endpoints with Postman
- Layered architecture working: Controller → Service → Repository → Database
- Step 4 completed: Built complete frontend user interface
- Created 4 files in src/main/resources/static: index.html, users.html, styles.css, js/app.js
- Two-column responsive layout with modern card-based design
- Full CRUD functionality: Create, Read, Update, Delete users via UI
- Features: loading spinner, success/error messages, user count badge, empty state, smooth animations
- Application accessible at http://localhost:8080 with working frontend-backend integration 
- Step 5 completed: Built complete expense tracking system
- Created Expense entity with BigDecimal for amount, LocalDate for date, and audit timestamps
- Created ExpenseRepository with custom query methods (findByUserId, findByUserIdOrderByDateDesc)
- Created ExpenseDTO, ExpenseService, ExpenseController following same layered architecture
- Implemented 6 REST endpoints including special endpoint for getting expenses by user
- Created expenses.html with enhanced styling and two-column layout
- Created expenses.js with full CRUD operations, amount/date formatting, loading states
- Updated styles.css with clean, minimal design for better UI across all pages
- Database table 'expenses' successfully created with all fields and proper constraints
- Successfully tested complete expense management flow: add, edit, delete, view
- - Steps 6 & 7 completed: Implemented JWT-based authentication and user registration
- Added Spring Security and JWT dependencies (jjwt-api, jjwt-impl, jjwt-jackson)
- Updated User entity with 'enabled' field for future email verification feature
- Created security package with JwtTokenProvider, JwtAuthenticationFilter, CustomUserDetailsService, SecurityConfig
- Created auth package with LoginRequest, LoginResponse, RegisterRequest DTOs
- Created AuthService handling registration (with BCrypt password encryption) and login logic
- Created AuthController with /api/auth/register and /api/auth/login endpoints
- Implemented SecurityConfig to protect all /api/** endpoints except /api/auth/**
- Created frontend authentication pages: login.html and register.html with modern gradient design
- Created auth.js handling login/register API calls, JWT token storage in localStorage
- Updated index.html to show login/register buttons or welcome message based on auth state
- Updated users.html and expenses.html with user info bar, logout button, and authentication protection
- Updated app.js and expenses.js to include JWT token in all API requests with Authorization header
- Added automatic redirect to login page when accessing protected pages without authentication
- Added 401/403 response handling to logout users with invalid/expired tokens
- Successfully tested complete authentication flow: register → login → access protected pages → logout
- All CRUD operations for users and expenses now require valid JWT authentication
